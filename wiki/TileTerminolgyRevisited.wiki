#summary The original internal structure of the board had critical flaws.

= Introduction =

The board closely resembles two things. An undirected graph and a co-ordinate system. We all learned about graphs in our Data Structures class, and implementing co-ordinates is just a simple class. We can use this data structures to store all the roads built  ( edge.hasRoad() ) and all the settlements/cities built( node.hasBuilding() ). We can then apply graph theory to discover each players longest road, to ensure no two settlements are built next to each other.


= Board layout =
The physical board, shown at the left, consists of a bunch of interconnected hexagons. If we straighten out those hexagons but maintain all of the intersections then we get the graph on the right side.
