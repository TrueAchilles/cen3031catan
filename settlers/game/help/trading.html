        <h1>Trading</h1>

            <p>Trading is essential to playing the game with any level of success.  You can either decide to trade with another player (either computer or human), trade through a port with the bank or trade directly with the Bank.</p>

            <h2>Trading Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>You can only trade in your own turn; this is called the Trade Phase.</li>
                <li>You must trade at least one card in any trade; no one can give you a card.</li>
                <li>You can trade with players with whatever ratio you feel with whatever mixture of cards.  As long as the other player agrees, the trade is acceptable.</li>
                <li>Port trading can be beneficial if you want to have a fixed rate for trading; however this option is only available if you have a settlement or city built on a port trade vertex.  There are 3:1 and 2:1 ratios available through ports.</li>
                <li>If you have an excess in resources, you can trade 4 resources of one kind to the bank for 1 card in return. This is a 4:1 ratio.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you want to modify a profile, this can be done by simply skipping step 4 and clicking on “Modify Profile” instead.</p>
