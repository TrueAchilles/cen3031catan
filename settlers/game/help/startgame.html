            <p>The following procedure will explain how to start a new game when you start the Settler’s app.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the "Player" tab on the upper left, and click "Add Player" > "Add Human Player."  The shortcut Ctrl+H accesses the same option.</li>
                <li>Create a name for your player, choose a color, an avatar (optional)*, and tick save user (optional)**.

                <li>Click on "Game" on the upper left, and "Reset Board" to start a new game. The shortcut Ctrl+O accesses the same option.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>*NOTE:</strong> In order to add an avatar, you must have a picture saved in your hard drive. Simply click "Choose a file", locate your avatar and click the "open" button to load your avatar to your profile.</p>
